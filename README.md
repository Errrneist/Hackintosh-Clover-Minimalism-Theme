# Hackintosh Minimalism Theme for Clover Bootloader
* Download is avaliable here by checking out the release of this project: [Release](https://github.com/Errrneist/Hackintosh-Theme-Minimalism/releases).
* Basically, it is a Minimalistic black and white theme for Clover boot loader when booting up.
## Note
* This theme might [break if you use it on higher versions of clover bootloader](https://github.com/Errrneist/Hackintosh-Clover-Minimalism-Theme/issues/1) cuz I made it in 2017.
* And this theme will not work on OpenCore.

## ChangeLog
* [20180315] Released V1.0, added Ubuntu icon support.
* [20200327] Released V2.0, added Razer Blade support on background.

## How-To
* To fire it up, unzip the release and add the folder `/Minimalism` under `EFI/CLOVER/themes`.
* Also change the `theme` in `config.plist` under `Root/GUI/Theme` to `Minimalism`.
* The recommended screen resolution for this theme is FHD, change the `ScreenResolution` to `1920x1080`.
* Although after testing I found out that UHD works fine as well.
